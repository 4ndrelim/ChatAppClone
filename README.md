# ChatAppClone

This repository contains code for a responsive, albeit simplified, clone of a popular messaging app. Project was done with a friend while learning Flutter. See here for our full-stack IG [clone](https://github.com/claudeonrs/instagram_clone)!

## Frameworks

Front-end: Flutter
Back-end: Firebase / TBC (to be implemented.. )

**Note**: The database is currently hard-coded since Firebase has yet to be mounted. But the front-end features have been (mostly navigation aspect) implemented and functional.

## Product Showcase

### Mobile Home Screen

<img src = './product_showcase/mobile_home_screen.jpeg' alt='Mobile home screen display' width='250'>

### Web Home Screen

**Note**: this layout is responsive, if the window is small, it transitions to mobile home screen's display.

<img src = './product_showcase/web_home_screen.jpeg' alt='Mobile home screen display' width='500'>

### Chat Screen (Similar layout for both Mobile & Web)

## Installation & Usage

The front-end portion of this project can be used entirely and independently. Users can also implement their preferred backend framework for data storage & loading. A sample backend code _coming soon_!

2. Clone with

```
